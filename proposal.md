# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Programming Music

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will entail coding my own synthesizer and other instruments which I will use to code a cover of a song using my own vocals from imported files and custom-coded instruments.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will use the magenta tensorflow website to use as a starting place to create my instruments. My software will use my instruments to create a coded arrangement of notes and loops to create the background music and imported audio files to use as vocals. I may code reverberation or other effects to use for my vocals or other instruments. The end result can be played on Garageband and maybe ProTools as well.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for this project is to code a custom synthesizer.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for this project is to code an array of at least 3 instruments.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for this project is to use my instruments to code an arrangement of a cover of a song using imported audio files for vocals only as well as coding the instrument tracks with the virtual instruments I coded.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research coding involved in instrument plug ins, and how I can use my synthesizer and other instruments in DAWs like Garageband and ProTools. I also need to use magenta.tensorflow.org to use as a starting base for my project. I will also need to spend time deciding what kind of instruments I want to create and what kind of sound I want them to make for the song I will be using them in. I will then need to figure out how to change the frequency and sound effect of each sound to match my desired outcome.
